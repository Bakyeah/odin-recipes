    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>From being a common street food to becoming one of the top listers in the fast food category .</p>
    <p><em>Pizza</em> was first introduced in Italy and easily became an integral part of the food community. </p>
     <p>Even before it's creation street vendors in Italy sold plain bread with many sort of toppings so the 
        exact time of it's invention is nearly impossible to trace.

        dough garnished with many sort of toppings and sauces . The combination of all these toppings in turn
        give it an out of this world taste helping it make its place among the top listers .
